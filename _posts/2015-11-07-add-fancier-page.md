# Update Your Website in a Cooler Way

Again, you will make and publish a new webpage on your website, and then
you'll have three pages, plus a series of commits and history of your code and
practice.

##  Option 1: Going Cowboy

If you are totally getting all of this, and you blew through the Codeacademy
tutorial on javascript and the book up to here, then you could be creative
now.

Make a page on your website that does something cool with JavaScript - a
little game or anything. Publish it to GitHub.com, just like we did last
chapter, and on index.html, add a link to it too of course.

##  Option 2: Precise Instructions

If you are still feeling unsteady, then follow these instructions to add a new
page to your website, with a bit of JavaScript.
