# Basic Web Programming

Sign up for a codeacademy.com account, and take the two most basic web
programming tutorials.

  * [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) \- Learn the basics about how to make and style a webpage that displays simple information. 
  * [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript) \- Learn how to make interactive programs, and make your websites come to life. 

## You're Getting Powerful Now

With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can fundamentally make any webpage, and
you'll understand how webpages get displayed.

Here are some simple examples that you could be doing next:

  * make a landing page for a new product 
  * make a custom poll
  * make a webpage that fetches some sports data and displays some charts

To build a complex site like Facebook, you also need to understand how to host
your own server and work with databases, and we get to those topics in later
chapters.
