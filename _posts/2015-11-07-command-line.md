# Learn the Command Line

The command line (AKA CLI or command line interface) is how you tell your
computer what to do, by typing text commands. On a Mac, you open the Terminal
program to use the command line, and it's a little different on Windows.

You need to learn the command line, because it comes up in programming a lot.
You use it to move files around, run scripts, and often to "check in" your
code to version control. When you see a really elite programmer at work, they
are blazingly fast on the command line.

So, to get started, do this [tutorial to learn about using the "Terminal" to
use the "command line."](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-
line).

In the next lesson, you'll use both the coding skills and command line skills
you now have. You'll make a real, live website, and learn how to use "Git" and
"github.com" to save your code into "version control." Before that next lesson
though, you'll need to install a text editor, so see next chapter.
