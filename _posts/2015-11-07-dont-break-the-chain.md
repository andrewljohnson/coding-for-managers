# Don't Break the Chain

If you have made it this far, you have published open source code on Github.
That's actually pretty amazing, so congratulations. Tell your friends you're a
programmer and you have a Github profile.

Now you just need to publish more and more, and you will acquire programming
skill rapidly. The two biggest factors that will affect whether you learn to
code are whether you openly show your work, and whether you do a little bit of
study each day.

People of all sorts of backgrounds, intelligence levels, and interest can
learn to code - yet those with persistence and openness will surpass their
peers quickly.

So, with that in mind, you should:

  * everytime you do a tutorial or produce any kind of code, check in your work to github.com (as discussed in the previous chapter)
  * do at least 15 minutes of study each day (per Seinfeld's don't break the chain approach)
  * tell your friend or mentor about your progress, and even blog about it - broadcast your work to all who will listen, and be open.
  * Consider making each project you do a new page on that origin Github pages site you did for a tutorial. It doesn't matter how small or silly it is - publish your work, and you'l have a record of your study that will help you proceed - real, live working programs on the web.
