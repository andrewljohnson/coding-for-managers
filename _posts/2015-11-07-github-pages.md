#  Use GitHub Pages for the Simplest Website

Do this [tutorial to create a basic website](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a
-guide-to-using-github-pages/start/new-project/project-page/).

This is a cool tutorial, because it's going to teach you both how to deploy a
real website, using the simplest free service (GitHub pages). Also, you'll
learn how to save your code into source control (using the "Git" tool, which
github.com makes easy).

This should be easy, now that you already did the basic programming and
command line chapters!

From here, you will iterate on the website you just made - adding a bunch of
programs and apps you build to practice.
