# Coding for Managers - Introduction

This manual assumes you don't know anything about computer programming. It
provides an introduction for someone who quickly wants to learn to write code
and build websites, apps, and other programs. You might be a manager,
entrepreneur, or aspiring to be a professional programmer. **Please note you
should use a Mac for this book.** Many of the resources use a Mac, and things
will be a little off for Windows and trip up a beginner.
