# Learn with a Friend

You'll learn 10X as fast if you do this curriculum with a friends, share
energy, and share ideas.

  * find a friend who also wants to learn to code, and agree to share work each day
  * find an experienced programmer, and tell them each day about your progress
  * If you have no one, but a willingness to learn, you can join my group too. Email me at [andrewljohnson@gmail.com](mailto:andrewljohnson@gmail.com)
