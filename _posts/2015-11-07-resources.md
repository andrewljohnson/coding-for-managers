## Resources

Rather than reinvent the wheel, for exercises in this I use websites and
tutorials that teach you to code.

So far, this includes:

  * Code Academy - <http://codeacademy.com>
  * Thinkful Tutorial -<https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/start/new-project/project-page/>
