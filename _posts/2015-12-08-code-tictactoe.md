# No UI, Just Logic

Next, let's code TicTacToe. We're not going to worry about displaying the board in a pretty way, just determining if moves are legal, and if the game is over (won, lost, or tied).

First, [read the stub for the code here](/projects/tictactoe/TicTacToe.js).

Then, [edit the stub here, using JFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/22eh7aLy/), which makes it easy to run the JavaScript code as you edit it.

If you get it working, add the code to your website!
