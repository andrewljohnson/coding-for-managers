<h2>You're Getting Powerful Now</h2>

<p>With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can fundamentally make any webpage, and you'll understand how webpages get displayed.</p> 

<p>Here are some simple examples that you could be doing next: </p>

<ul>
  <li>make a landing page for a new product </li>
  <li>make a custom poll</li>
  <li>make a webpage that fetches some sports data and displays some charts</li>
</ul>

<p>To build a complex site like Facebook, you also need to understand how to host your own server and work with databases, and we get to those topics in later chapters.</p>
