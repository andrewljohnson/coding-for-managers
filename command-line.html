    <h1>Learn the Command Line</h1>
    <p>
      The command line (AKA CLI or command line interface) is how you tell your computer what to do, by typing text commands. On a Mac, you open the Terminal program to use the command line, and it's a little different on Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
    	You need to learn the command line, because it comes up in programming a lot. You use it to move files around, run scripts, and often to "check in" your code to version control. When you see a really elite programmer at work, they are blazingly fast on the command line.

    <p>So, to get started, do this <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line">tutorial to learn about using the "Terminal" to use the "command line."</a>.</p>

    <p>In the next lesson, you'll use both the coding skills and command line skills you now have. You'll make a real, live website, and learn how to use "Git" and "github.com" to save your code into "version control." Before that next lesson though, you'll need to install a text editor, so see next chapter.</p>
