<h1>Don't Break the Chain</h1>
<p>The two biggest factors that will affect whether you learn to code are whether you openly show your work, and whether you do a little bit of study each day.</p>

<p>People of all sorts of backgrounds, intelligence levels, and interest can learn to code - yet those with persistence and openness will surpass their peers quickly.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, you should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>everytime you do a tutorial or produce any kind of code, check in your work to github.com (as discussed in the previous chapter)</li>
	<li>do at least 15 minutes of study each day (per Seinfeld's don't break the chain approach)</li>
	<li>tell your friend or mentor about your progress, and even blog about it - broadcast your work to all who will listen, and be open.</li>
</ul>
