<h1>JQuery - A Good Thing to Understand</h1>

p>Now that you have the basics of JavaScript, take the <a href=https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery>JQuery tutorial on Code Academy</a>. 

<p>Most developers don't write JQuery anymore, but:

<ul>
<li>it was a breakthrough way to write JavaScript - it made it easier and more powerful

<li>you still run across it a lot today when reading code or doing work

<li>once you understand how JQuery relates to JavaScript, you'll understand more easily how other "frameworks" differ from JavaScript. You must learn "plain vanilla JavaScript," but you'll eventually just want to write using a framework that isn't so basic (just for example, you might use react.js and ES6 - some advanced frameworks you should learn later)</li>

</ul>
