Don't even bother reading this or later until you finish "Basic Web Programming" above.

     Now, take the JQuery tutorial. Most developers don't write JQuery anymore, but:

      * it was a breakthrough way to write JavaScript - it made it easier and more powerful

      * you still run across it a lot today when reading code or doing work

      * once you understand how JQuery relates to JavaScript, you'll understand more easily how other "frameworks" differ from JavaScript. You must learn "plain vanilla JavaScript," but you'll eventually just want to write using a framework that isn't so basic (like what we cover below... react.js and ES6)
