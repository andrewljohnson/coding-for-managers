<h1>Work with a Friend</h1>
<p>You'll learn 10X as fast if you do this curriculum with a friends, share energy, and share ideas.</p>

<ul>
  <li>find a friend who also wants to learn to code, and agree to share work each day</li>
  <li>find an experienced programmer, and tell them each day about your progress</li>
  <li>If you have no one, but a willingness to learn, you can join my group too. Email me at <a href=mailto:andrewljohnson@gmail.com>andrewljohnson@gmail.com</a></li>
</ul>
