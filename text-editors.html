    <h2>Install a Text Editor</h3>
    <p></p>Install a Text Editor. I use Sublime Text. You will use this to edit your code. You're going to start needing this at this point in the book.</p>
    <p>This is the main tool of your job, and part of the curriculum is getting good with it.</p> 
    <p>Sometimes, you will use similar tools like XCode for iPhone programming, or Android Studio for Android programming. You end up using a lot of text editors as a programmer - get used to it!</p>
    <p>Microsoft Word is not suitable for writing code :)</p>
