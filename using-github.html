<h1>Show Your Work - GitHub.com</h1>
<p>When you finish a bit of code in the first tutorial, check the code into github.com. Github.com builds on "git" - a tool basically all programmers use to save their code.</p>

<p>Git lets you both save, and keep track of the entire revision history - this ends up being very useful, since you might want look at old versions of your code, or even rollback if your code breaks and you don't know how to fix it.</p>

<h2>How to Push to GitHub</h2>
<p><a href=https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/>Follow these instructions to get the code you just wrote on GitHub.com</a>. These instructions tell you how to use the "command line," and I recommend that's how you start, so you can get a really deep understanding of th git tool.</p>

<p>However, those instructions also link to another page, which teaches you to use a GUI to push your code to github.com. </p>

<h2>Command Line Tutorial</h2>
<p>If you get stuck trying to push your code to github.com, step back and take this <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line">quick command line tutorial</a>, which may break the ice for you. I really suggest you struggle a bit here, and don't just use the Github desktop GUI tool - this will stunt your growth as a programmer.</p>

<p>This is also where having a mentor or friend kicks in. I've seen people get stuck trying to push their code to github.com, and it usually just takes two heads to muddle through any issues.</p>

<h1>Open Source All of Your Code</h1>
<p>When you push to github.com, choose an "MIT" license for your code when prompted. You'll be best served if you make your code as free and open as possible to start - trust me, no one will steal it, and people will help you learn if you publish your work openly.</p>
